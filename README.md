Causality (Series)

Causality is about evaluating the causal connections in a system and using them to answer questions. This series explores key ideas from the field, mainly based on the work of Judea Pearl. Each topic is accompanied by a YouTube video and Medium blog post. For those with code examples, the notebooks are freely available in this repo.
